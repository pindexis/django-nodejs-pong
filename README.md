guiding principles:
   - separates game Logic, Networking, and Visual drawing
   - Server is the only authoritative source: simulation of the game is done
also in the server and scores are calculated there.
   - dry principle (don't repeat yourself), sharing same game logic file between
players and server.


to be improved (not enough time) :
   - better Synchronization between players and server.
   - game Design
   - Documenting  code
